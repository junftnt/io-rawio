// ExtractFD attempts to extract a usable file descriptor from x -- which must
// be either an *os.File or an object with a method having a signature of
// "File() (*os.File, error)", such as most implementations of net.Conn. If x
// is something else, ErrNoFD is returned.
//
// If x is an *os.File, its Fd method is called -- otherwise, an *os.File is
// aquired from the aforementioned File method and its Fd method is called.
// In either case, a file descriptor is acquired then duped and the duplicate
// file descriptor is returned.
//
// Prior to returning, Close is called on the *os.File used to acquire the
// original file descriptor and, if x is not an *os.File but is an io.Closer,
// x will also be closed. If any of these close operations result in an error,
// the duped file descriptor is also closed and an error is returned.
//
// On success, a usable file descriptor and a nil error are returned and the
// object from which it was extracted will be closed and no longer usable.
//
// Note: We dupe the file descriptor before returning it because os.File has
// a finalizer routine which calls Close when the object is garbage collected.
// This also closes the file descriptor returned by its Fd method.
//
// Deprecated: With the advent of the syscall.RawConn interface introduced in
// Go v1.12, ExtractFD is no longer necessary.
